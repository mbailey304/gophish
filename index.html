	<p> As you may know, the fires in California have deeply impacted some of our peers. 
	I’m hoping we can come together to create a meaningful care package—not asking for monetary support but by helping them navigate and access critical resources during this challenging time.
	To get things started, I’ve put together this collaborative sheet.
	Please add your thoughts, resources, or suggestions—it doesn’t have to be a big commitment; every little bit helps.

	<td>My recommendation is we could start a canned food drive and reach out to the Red Cross or another relief association regarding the donation.</td>
	<td>We could reach out to the dean's office and see if there are any outreach programs we could partake in</td>
