<body>

	<p> As you may know, the fires in California have deeply impacted some of our peers. 
	I’m hoping we can come together to create a meaningful care package—not asking for monetary support but by helping them navigate and access critical resources during this challenging time.
	To get things started, I’ve put together this collaborative sheet.
	Please add your thoughts, resources, or suggestions—it doesn’t have to be a big commitment; every little bit helps.
